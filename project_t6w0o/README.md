# My Personal Project

## Personalize your own menu!


This application enables people to add their favourite
dishes to a menu. They can add different features of the dish and then
personalize their menu. People who enjoy eating and sharing food will
love this application.

I chose this project because I enjoy different types of food personally.
I always wanted to have my own menu that fits my own taste. I also want
to share food that I enjoy with others. Therefore, I want to use the
application I write to continue sharing my love for food with others.

**Phase 4: Task 3**

- One thing I can do to improve this project is that I can write some helper methods in the GUI class.
Even though they do not exceed the requirement, some methods in that class are long and repetitive. 
Therefore, I can write helper methods to make them more clear and clean.
